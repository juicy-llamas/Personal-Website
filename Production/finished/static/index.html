						<h1>Peer to Peer Projects</h1>
						<p class="p-big-c">Over the years, I've liked theorizing about a number of exotic networking ideas involving P2P. These are some of the ideas I've had, but may are very incomplete if even implemented in code.</p>
						<p class="p-big-norm">I've also since learned that part of the reason I've been so ineffective is because of my choice of language (C). Henceforth, if I were to keep developing these, I would want to use Rust, C++, or maybe Go, with a leaning towards Rust especially for secure applications.</p>
						<div class="emph-border">
							<h3><a href="https://github.com/juicy-llamas/syncy-thing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">File Sharing Utility</a></h3>
							<p>If I was going to continue working on any one of these, I would choose this one first. It is by far the most useful of the bunch in that I keep getting somewhat frustrated I haven't made it yet and I can't use it. I often work on 2-3 computers at any given time, and sometimes I wish they could just <i>sync</i>, so that I don't have to worry about things like uploading and downloading from/to Google Drive, USB drives, GitHub for file storage, Bluetooth, or any of the other stuff. The most effective method I have is KDEConnect, which can pair (KDE) systems and allow them to access each other's functionality. You can do stuff like run remote commands, type on one computer with another computer, and yes, you can share files. They even have a companion app for Android, which I actually use somewhat regularly. But it only works as a one off thing, and in the end, this particular implementation isn't that much better than Bluetooth.</p>
							<p>But what if they could just <i>sync</i>? What if I could just set something up <i>one time</i> that gave my other systems access to folders on the system I'm using right now, or vice versa? Then I can go out, do some edits on a file. Then, once I'm at home and using my home WiFi, the laptop can connect to the others (securely) and sync the changes. Of course, you only exclusively want to do this on your home network, and you only want to do this with computers that you specifically authorize, so you can do a preliminary check with MAC addresses or hostnames (In my experience, DHCP Routers (that dynamically allocate IPs instead of a static router) usually retain the IPs of recurring devices on the network, but best not to take chances and lock yourself out). Then, you can authenticate using public key encryption, where each system has a key pair (or just simply do this first). Thus, each peer on the network would have to first check if they're on the right network, and then reach out to other computers and issue their challenge. After the peers pass the challenge, they then will wait (in a non busy way, no while loops with sleep) for either their files to update or an incoming file from another peer.</p>
							<p>I've tested and written components of this project. I've sent files using sockets and developed a command line parser for it. The project, though, is quite an undertaking despite having those small wins.</p>

							<h3><a href="https://github.com/juicy-llamas/p2p-video-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Video Sharing Idea</a></h3>
							<p>Video servers need a huge amount of storage and bandwidth to make their systems work, which one of the reasons why there are so few social media industries, especially those involving video. But what if you, a company, didn't even need to host any video? What if you could just let the users of your platform do the hosting? Hence the idea. The site and app themselves would be free to use provided you set up a server to help out the network (which is really the cost of the network).</p>
							<p>Technically, this idea would prove to be incredibly ambitious, with a high amount of concurrency involved, not to mention data integrity, compression, and load balancing to worry about. I could perhaps use rust libraries to help with some of these challenges, as recently I've decided to embrace rust, but even still, the
							<p>There are also a lot of other issues with this; the biggest one being the fact that most people would probably rather just watch ads than set up what is essentially a home server <i>and</i> watch ads. There is not much unique about the service to get people to use <i>it</i> rather than other alternatives, including other existing P2P video sharing sites. I don't like youtube's interface.s</p>
						</div>
						<div class="emph-border">
							<h3>Chat Server</h3>
							<p>This is one of the very first projects I came up with. The premise was to develop a secure, multithreaded P2P chat application. It's also the one I got the farthest into; I even managed to successfully create an app (buggy piece of s*** written in C) that creates a thread (using <code>clone</code>, not <code>pthread</code>) for each incoming client. I learned a decent amount about linux system calls and signals while doing this.</p>
							<p>Like a lot of my projects, though, I dreamed incredibly big and ended up not following through.</p>
						</div>
						<h1>Programming Language Projects</h1>
						<div class="emph-border">
							<h3><a href="https://github.com/juicy-llamas/MLang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MLang</a></h3>
							<p>I've wanted to make a language that has a traditional, imperative-like interface, but is semi-functional in nature and can run massively parallely using a compiler to compile to bytecode and a scheduler to run the bytecode on various different processors (that also acts as a JIT and caches compiled code/performance data for quick subsequent startups and faster performance). This is a tall order, so I thought I would make a programming language first.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="emph-border">
							<h3><a href="https://github.com/juicy-llamas/MLang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lexers</a></h3>
							<p>I've made a few lexers in the past; one in haskell, one in Go, one in C (though idk where that one is), and one in OCaml as part of a school project. I regard writing a lexer in a coding language as a good intermediate project for learning; it touches on several subjects such as file IO, branching, looping, management of state, and custom objects. I have also tried to make parsers for ASTs, but I haven't quite gotten the hang of them.</p>
						</div>
						<h1>Other Projects</h1>
						<div class="emph-border">
							<h3><a href="https://github.com/juicy-llamas/finance-bot-experiments" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finance Bot Experimentation</a></h3>
							<p>Similar to many projects, this didn't go much of anywhere. Mainly, this is because that experimenting with investing requires money, and money requires a job, so I want to get one of those first. I have had some ideas about using NLP to predict stocks in the medium to long term instead of the short term, extracting dates, key words, and sentiment, but it seems like others lately have been doing similar things. It's something I'll think about in the future.</p>
							<p>What did come out of this is a neat little automatic proxy configurer and user agent spoofer that rotates between free proxies from three different websites. Each site has an API that fetches a list of proxies in a text file, as I didn't want to use BeautifulSoup to create a custom parser for each site, though I could have. I then go through the list and check whether the proxy is 'valid,' meaning it does actually connect to a host and it replaces my IP with the proxy server's. Once I find a valid proxy, I send a request to the target server. Subsequent requests can be sent, or if the request didn't go through, we just pick a new, working proxy and try again.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="emph-border">
							<h3><a href="https://github.com/juicy-llamas/rust-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rust HTTP Server</a></h3>
							<p>This is a neat little project to learn Rust. I could have copied the HTTP server code already given in the Rust Book, but I opted to just dive in and create my own. I have serving code set up, but now I need a header parser and actual control over what gets served. If all goes right, I plan to replace the Express.js server hosting this site with that server.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="emph-border">
							<h3><a href="https://github.com/juicy-llamas/cintp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"C Interpreter"</a></h3>
							<p>I started out with wanting a neat, convenient way to test out C code. Originally, I would either write a file, a lot of boilerplate, save the file, compile the file, run it, and then either delete the file or forget about it, or I would search for a C compiler online that would take time, be tempermental (if I accidentally closed the tab), and I would still have to write boilerplate. Why couldn't there be a simple, one-command-one-key way to just type a phrase, drop down to an editor that has a customized template, and  Then, I realized I needed a text editor. Not thinking writing one was too bad (in C), I decided to go for it, but the terminal's default operating mode wasn't sufficient, so I quickly fell down a mini rabbit hole of escape sequences and segmentation faults. I didn't think to use a debugger until the very end of the project, but at that point, I made a very buggy (don't use the enter key too much) but technically useable text editor. My original goal escaped me for a while, but coming back to it, I just decided to use Nano instead to create a functional application.</p>

							<h3>Design History</h3>
							<p>I knew I wanted to make my site with WebGL from the start, to test my abilities. At the very beginning, I was just beginning to learn the general workflow of WebGL bit by bit, and it seemed very foreign, as I didn't quite understand the low-level GL calls. It took me a while to get even an image to display on a screen, but I kept persevering and fixing various GL errors, and it finally worked. GL has a particular workflow with pushing buffers to be rendered, and labeling correctly. It was really a learning process the entire time to get GL to work well, and as I learned more, I was able to do more things (like draw circles on the screen). I could have even made some post processing effects, but I stopped it here because I am eager to get this done.</p>
							<p>Once I got the GL components secured, I then began working on the javascript controller that processes inputs, resizes the window, etc. I had particular difficulty trying to get the circles to render on the screen, and I've ended up using what amounts to a guess-and-check method to get nice, even distributions of circles. Sometimes, though, you may have to reload the page if a circle wanders too close to the edge.</p>
							<h3>Difficulties</h3>
							<p>As I said, working with GL was the first major difficulty in this project, mainly because of the limited debugging available. The second problem I ran into (and still have trouble with) is Firefox. For some weird reason, Chrome (and Chromium) seem to work like a charm with WebGL related projects, and Firefox runs them, but it is severely limited in performance. It runs 20-30 FPS on a system that should be more than capable of pushing at least 120-130 (actually it gets >160 on Chrome). What is more mysterious is that Firefox actually seems to be using the GPU correctly. Perhaps something in Firefox's internal render loop is incredibly inefficient, or maybe SpiderMonkey is less efficient than V8. This also affects the Wasted site (below), and other applications that are heavy on javascript, so there seems to be little I can do about it.</p>
							<h3>What I would change if I did it over</h3>
							<p>At this point, WebGL is great, but for something simple like this, I would opt for pure CSS3 animations. Either that, or if I wanted to specifically use WebGL, I should have done something (like use post processing effects) that could only be done with WebGL. Stay tuned for updates on that. CSS animations, on the other hand, aren't necessarily smooth and bouncy, like the Euler's method model I implemented, but they would work and be much simpler to implement. Perhaps using CSS3 animations would increase performance on Firefox as well. Another thing would be to split my JS into compartments. Perhaps even having multiple different site templates, and injecting templates into a main page using django or node.js would be ideal (or just using React).</p>
						</div>
						<h1>Tales of the Wasted West Website</h1>
						<div class="soft-box">
							<h3>Design History</h3>
							<p>Since I already had a smooth parallax effect from my personal website, I just copied that over to the Wasted Site and started there. My original idea was to have a sort of tiered parallax effect, with three images moving around at different rates. So I started development by changing my original monotonic parallax effect to be 'scalable' by encapsulating the functionality in a class. Then, I piped the WebGL output to a framebuffer passed in as an argument, and I also took a second 'previous output' image and mixed the two together in the frag shader. It was just a matter, then, of setting up two framebuffers and chaining them via the arguments of the functions in such a way so that the background image rendered first, the midground rendered next, and then the foreground image rendered last and pipelined to the null framebuffer (screen). I actually put a lot of work into that, but I quickly realized that creating the images in a way to make the effect look convincing took some doing, and was very troublesome for me, so I simply cut my losses and rendered it as one page. I also copied and modified a set of link effects that someone else made on CoDrops (put info here).  After all, that was really just the beginning of the work to come.</p>

							<h3>Difficulties and Changes</h3>
							<p>Similar to my own site, I created somewhat of a monolithic set of three files. I'm used to discretizing my files by page, but in these single page applications, I haven't figured out how to structure them yet. Using react would be a good idea, if I'm going to make another website. I also made all of the animations myself, other than specifically the link ones, which I heavily modified. Making all of your own animations on a website is somewhat of a tiring process, especially with javascript and using <code>setTimeout</code> to coordinate things, so in the future, I think I will try to integrate as much of the animations as possible in CSS instead of doing it in javascript (there would still need to be a bit of javascript handling). Also, a friend of mine said that he starts with doing mobile development first and then desktop development. I will try to do that from now on; when I do it the other way, what often ends up happening is I get a lot of mouseover events, which are cool, but awkward to hook up in a mobile setting, as there is no real substitute for dragging the cursor in a touch environment.</p>

						<p class="p-big-c">Welcome to the mess that is this project.</p>
						<h2>History</h2>
						<p>Long ago, when I was just a budding high schooler, I wanted to make an operating system. I actually don't have an idea as to why I thought this was an appropriate project, other than the fact that I generally like to understand how things work, and I was fascinated with computers. This was the culmination of that. Before this, I played with various sorts of things, like circuitry. I was particularly fascinated with how SR latches worked, and I even implemented my own little SR latch with transistors. I actually have a video about that on my youtube channel. After I got comfortable with latches, and addition on computers, I tried to create processors in simulations. At first, I did this in Minecraft, where I built a horifically slow and incomplete processor.</p>
						<h2>'Features'</h2>
						<div class="lr-divider">
							<img class="l-small" src="Assets/os1.jpeg" crossOrigin="anonymous"></img>
							<div class="r-big">
								<p>The 'Operating System' is basically a terminal interface to absolutely nothing. However, it is a functioning terminal interface, complete with functioning keys, a working terminal, commands such as 'help' and 'echo', and even the ability to change the color. To even get to this point took a while for me, and by this point, I wanted to get started on task management and creating processes. Unfortunately, I didn't have much of an idea of what I was doing, so I was kinda lost as to how to implement memory and task management. I even tried to implement my own form of malloc at one point, but even then I thought that was kinda stupid as the program could just ignore the artificially set boundaries (or crash). I had to implement paging at some level to bootstrap the OS into protected mode, but I was unaware that this feature was actually intended for use on programs and not just something annoying I had to do at boot (there were a lot of those). Needless to say, the task management never came to fruition, and the last I worked on it, I remember trying to read the intel developer's manual entry on the TSS and being confused.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<h2>Future?</h2>
						<div class="lr-divider">
							<p class="l-big">If I were to embark on this again, I would probably just start from scratch. For one, I wouldn't code the entire thing in Assembly. I would at least use C, and maybe, if I could get a stable kernel working, incorporate Rust code. Rust is great because, when you're working in 'safe' mode, the compiler catches many common erroneous glitches. The problem, though, is that a good chunk of the code would still be unsafe because of the nature of drivers and other things, but it's still an improvement. I would probably write Rust functions in a static library and call them in the C code, or maybe even vice versa. The first real thing I would implement (besides basic interrupt and exception handling) is probably a PCI driver for getting information about memory mapped devices. Next, I would implement a memory / time allocator that can create, run, and kill tasks concurrently and multi-threaded. That itself is going to be an incredibly tall order, but provided I get that done, the next logical step would be implementing a shell so the user can launch tasks (that itself is a task) and then a USB driver for accessing disk storage (I would probably be booting this thing off of a USB drive). I could also thrown in a S/ATA driver for accessing hard disks. That would probably take about a year, but all told, I would have a neat little functioning operating system.</p>

						<h1>The Joys of Sunvox</h1>
						<div class="lr-divider">
							<img class="l-big" src="Assets/sunvox.png" crossOrigin="anonymous"></img>
							<p class='r-small'><a href="https://warmplace.ru/soft/sunvox/">Sunvox</a> is a free, modular synth that allows for the creation of rich, complex instruments from relatively simple building blocks. It has a relatively simple interface and set of systems, in contrast with something like a DAW, like FL Studio or LMMS. While it is a synth, you can also edit samples and create tracker patterns to create and edit full songs, so it could be considered a DAW in it's own right (though it does not support VSTs, and is minimalistic in it's feature set). I personally have used Sunvox mostly to create EDM style music like dubstep, house, trap, and other kinds of groves that really don't have a category. I have also used it to import and edit live samples of me playing other instruments, such as guitar or bass, in a way that you would use audacity to accomplish something similar. I also used it to synthesize gunshot sounds (from scratch--using noise, and also a clingy/metallic sounding sample that was part of the project) for Tales of the Wasted West. Once you learn the interface, it becomes a really powerful and simple tool to do most anything you need with not just music but sound design in general.</p>

								<p>I am a programmer that has spent over 9 years doing some type of programming or other. I'm also currently a Senior in college, and I'll be graduating in the Fall of 2023. I started programming seriously by getting into how computers work at a fundamental level. I slowly built up my understanding, learning about electronics, logic gates, various types of latches, control logic, processors, assembly, and then operating systems. This ultimately culminated into a few designs for 4 bit processors (which I don't have anymore ☹️) and my attempt at building my own operating system in assembly, which you can read more about in 'OS Dev'.</p>
								<p>I was in for a rude awakening though, as I discovered that doing things in a really hard, difficult, and esoteric way to have control over how they worked was not only not efficient with my time, it was actualy bad for efficiency, security, scalability, and just overall maintainability. Eventually, I have matured as a developer and adopted languages like Rust and Python and frameworks like Node.js to automate some things. Sometimes, complete understanding is not the goal, getting stuff done is.</p>

						<p>Other things I like to do with my time are musical and working out. I've also taken up reading novels recently; I got to the fourth book of The Dark Tower series, I've started to read Game of Thrones for the first time, and I've begun reading Piers Anthony's Virtual Mode, which is just something I found on the bookshelf (it's pretty good, and uplifting, which is nice). I would really like to get into car modding and other mechanical things, but a lack of equiptment and a 'project car' (no; I'm not using my own car to do anything except maybe change the air filter and rotate tires) makes this rather difficult.</p>
