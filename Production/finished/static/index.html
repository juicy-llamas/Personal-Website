						<h1>Peer to Peer Projects</h1>
						<p class="p-big-c">Over the years, I've liked theorizing about a number of exotic networking ideas involving P2P. These are some of the ideas I've had, but may are very incomplete if even implemented in code.</p>
						<div class="emph-border">
							<h3>File Sharing Utility</h3>
							<p>If I was going to continue working on any one of these, I would choose this one first. It is by far the most useful of the bunch in that I keep getting somewhat frustrated I haven't made it yet and I can't use it. I often work on 2-3 computers at any given time, and sometimes I wish they could just <i>sync</i>, so that I don't have to worry about things like uploading and downloading from/to Google Drive, USB drives, GitHub for file storage, Bluetooth, or any of the other stuff. The most effective method I have is KDEConnect, which can pair (KDE) systems and allow them to access each other's functionality. You can do stuff like run remote commands, type on one computer with another computer, and yes, you can share files. They even have a companion app for Android, which I actually use somewhat regularly. But it only works as a one off thing, and in the end, this particular implementation isn't that much better than Bluetooth.</p>
							<p>But what if they could just <i>sync</i>? What if I could just set something up <i>one time</i> that gave my other systems access to folders on the system I'm using right now, or vice versa? Then I can go out, do some edits on a file. Then, once I'm at home and using my home WiFi, the laptop can connect to the others (securely) and sync the changes. Of course, you only exclusively want to do this on your home network, and you only want to do this with computers that you specifically authorize, so you can do a preliminary check with MAC addresses or hostnames (In my experience, DHCP Routers (that dynamically allocate IPs instead of a static router) usually retain the IPs of recurring devices on the network, but best not to take chances and lock yourself out). Then, you can authenticate using public key encryption, where each system has a key pair (or just simply do this first). Thus, each peer on the network would have to first check if they're on the right network, and then reach out to other computers and issue their challenge. After the peers pass the challenge, they then will wait (in a non busy way, no while loops with sleep) for either their files to update or an incoming file from another peer.</p>
							<p>I've tested and written components of this project. I've sent files using sockets and developed a command line parser for it. The project, though, is quite an undertaking despite having those small wins.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="emph-border">
							<h3>Video Sharing Idea</h3>
							<p>Video servers need a huge amount of storage and bandwidth to make their systems work, which one of the reasons why there are so few social media industries, especially those involving video. But what if you, a company, didn't even need to host any video? What if you could just let the users of your platform do the hosting? Hence the idea. The site and app themselves would be free to use provided you set up a server to help out the network (which is really the cost of the network).</p>
							<p>Technically, this idea would prove to be incredibly ambitious, with a high amount of concurrency involved, not to mention data integrity, compression, and load balancing to worry about. I could perhaps use rust libraries to help with some of these challenges, as recently I've decided to embrace rust, but even still, the
							<p>There are also a lot of other issues with this; the biggest one being the fact that most people would probably rather just watch ads than set up what is essentially a home server <i>and</i> watch ads. There is not much unique about the service to get people to use <i>it</i> rather than other alternatives, including other existing P2P video sharing sites. I don't like youtube's interface.s</p>
						</div>
						<div class="emph-border">
							<h3>Chat Server</h3>
							<p>This is one of the very first projects I came up with. The premise was to develop a secure, multithreaded P2P chat application. It's also the one I got the farthest into; I even managed to successfully create an app (buggy piece of s*** written in C) that creates a thread (using <code>clone</code>, not <code>pthread</code>) for each incoming client. I learned a decent amount about linux system calls and signals while doing this.</p>
							<p>Like a lot of my projects, though, I dreamed incredibly big and ended up not following through.</p>

						<h1>This Site</h1>

							<h3>Design History</h3>
							<p>I knew I wanted to make my site with WebGL from the start, to test my abilities. At the very beginning, I was just beginning to learn the general workflow of WebGL bit by bit, and it seemed very foreign, as I didn't quite understand the low-level GL calls. It took me a while to get even an image to display on a screen, but I kept persevering and </p>
							<h3>Difficulties</h3>
							<h3>What I would change if I did it over</h2>
							<p>At this point, WebGL is great, but for something simple like this, I would opt for pure CSS3 animations. The only thing about CSS animations is that they aren't necessarily smooth, like the euler's model I implemented, but they would work. Another thing would be to split my JS into compartments. Perhaps even having multiple different site templates, and injecting templates into a main page using django or node.js would be ideal.</p>
						</div>
						<h1>The Wasted West</h1>
						<div class="soft-box">
							<h3>Design History</h3>
							<p>Since I already had a smooth parallax effect from my personal website, I just copied that over to the Wasted Site and started there. My original idea was to have a sort of tiered parallax effect, with three images moving around at different rates. So I started development by changing my original monotonic parallax effect to be 'scalable' by encapsulating the functionality in a class. Then, I piped the WebGL output to a framebuffer passed in as an argument, and I also took a second 'previous output' image and mixed the two together in the frag shader. It was just a matter, then, of setting up two framebuffers and chaining them via the arguments of the functions in such a way so that the background image rendered first, the midground rendered next, and then the foreground image rendered last and pipelined to the null framebuffer (screen). I actually put a lot of work into that, but I quickly realized that creating the images in a way to make the effect look convincing took some doing, and was very troublesome for me, so I simply cut my losses and rendered it as one page. After all, that was really just the beginning of the work to come.</p>

						<p class="p-big-c">Welcome to the mess that is this project.</p>
						<h2>History</h2>
						<p>Long ago, when I was just a budding high schooler, I wanted to make an operating system. I actually don't have an idea as to why I thought this was an appropriate project, other than the fact that I generally like to understand how things work, and I was fascinated with computers. This was the culmination of that. Before this, I played with various sorts of things, like circuitry. I was particularly fascinated with how SR latches worked, and I even implemented my own little SR latch with transistors. I actually have a video about that on my youtube channel. After I got comfortable with latches, and addition on computers, I tried to create processors in simulations. At first, I did this in Minecraft, where I built a horifically slow and incomplete processor.</p>
						<h2>'Features'</h2>
						<div class="lr-divider">
							<img class="l-small" src="Assets/os1.jpeg" crossOrigin="anonymous"></img>
							<div class="r-big">
								<p>The 'Operating System' is basically a terminal interface to absolutely nothing. However, it is a functioning terminal interface, complete with functioning keys, a working terminal, commands such as 'help' and 'echo', and even the ability to change the color. To even get to this point took a while for me, and by this point, I wanted to get started on task management and creating processes. Unfortunately, I didn't have much of an idea of what I was doing, so I was kinda lost as to how to implement memory and task management. I even tried to implement my own form of malloc at one point, but even then I thought that was kinda stupid as the program could just ignore the artificially set boundaries (or crash). I had to implement paging at some level to bootstrap the OS into protected mode, but I was unaware that this feature was actually intended for use on programs and not just something annoying I had to do at boot (there were a lot of those). Needless to say, the task management never came to fruition, and the last I worked on it, I remember trying to read the intel developer's manual entry on the TSS and being confused.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<h2>Future?</h2>
						<div class="lr-divider">
							<p class="l-big">If I were to embark on this again, I would probably just start from scratch. For one, I wouldn't code the entire thing in Assembly. I would at least use C, and maybe, if I could get a stable kernel working, incorporate Rust code. Rust is great because, when you're working in 'safe' mode, the compiler catches many common erroneous glitches. The problem, though, is that a good chunk of the code would still be unsafe because of the nature of drivers and other things, but it's still an improvement. I would probably write Rust functions in a static library and call them in the C code, or maybe even vice versa. The first real thing I would implement (besides basic interrupt and exception handling) is probably a PCI driver for getting information about memory mapped devices. Next, I would implement a memory / time allocator that can create, run, and kill tasks concurrently and multi-threaded. That itself is going to be an incredibly tall order, but provided I get that done, the next logical step would be implementing a shell so the user can launch tasks (that itself is a task) and then a USB driver for accessing disk storage (I would probably be booting this thing off of a USB drive). I could also thrown in a S/ATA driver for accessing hard disks. That would probably take about a year, but all told, I would have a neat little functioning operating system.</p>

								<p>I am a programmer that has spent over 9 years doing some type of programming or other. I'm also currently a Senior in college, and I'll be graduating in the Fall of 2023. I started programming seriously by getting into how computers work at a fundamental level. I slowly built up my understanding, learning about electronics, logic gates, various types of latches, control logic, processors, assembly, and then operating systems. This ultimately culminated into a few designs for 4 bit processors (which I don't have anymore ☹️) and my attempt at building my own operating system in assembly, which you can read more about in 'OS Dev'.</p>
								<p>I was in for a rude awakening though, as I discovered that doing things in a really hard, difficult, and esoteric way to have control over how they worked was not only not efficient with my time, it was actualy bad for efficiency, security, scalability, and just overall maintainability. Eventually, I have matured as a developer and adopted languages like Rust and Python and frameworks like Node.js to automate some things. </p>
